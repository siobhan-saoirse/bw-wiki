# bw-wiki
This is a GitHub repository intended to help preserve the history, documentation and the known users of BonziWORLD without the need of excessive amounts of misinformation, lies, antisemitism, racism, bigotry, transphobia, and xenophobia.
It can be accessed [here](https://github.com/siobhan-saoirse/bw-wiki/wiki).

No one except those who I trust will able to contribute, create issues nor edit the wiki in order to prevent attacks from the long-term campaign of harassment towards me, my friends and family, and my wife.
